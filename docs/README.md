# Optimize my Image - Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the "Optimize my Image" application. This document provides a high-level overview of the project, its features, and technology stack.

## Overview

"Optimize my Image" is an advanced, client-side image optimization tool designed for web performance. It allows users to resize, compress, rename, and convert images directly in their browser. A key feature is its privacy-first approachâ€”no images are ever uploaded to a server. The application also leverages the Google Gemini API to intelligently generate SEO-friendly alt text for images.

## Key Features

-   **Client-Side Processing**: All image manipulation happens in the browser, ensuring user data remains 100% private.
-   **Smart Resizing**: Adjust image dimensions while automatically maintaining the aspect ratio.
-   **Powerful Compression**: Fine-tune image quality to find the perfect balance between file size and visual fidelity.
-   **Format Conversion**: Convert images to modern formats like WebP, alongside standard JPEG and PNG.
-   **Batch Processing**: Upload and optimize up to 10 images simultaneously. Apply settings to all images with a single click.
-   **Custom Naming**: Generate clean, descriptive filenames based on project, section, and element names for better SEO and organization.
-   **AI-Powered Alt Text**: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to automatically generate descriptive alt text for images, improving accessibility and SEO.
-   **Theming & Dark Mode**: A customizable UI with multiple color themes and full light/dark mode support.
-   **Multi-language Support**: Available in English and German.
